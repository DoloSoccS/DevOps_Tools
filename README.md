The intent of this repository is to display and define the different uses for development tools.
The flask app will be the static deliverable.

The tools I intend to use are:
Docker for App Deployment
Kubernetes for Scaling
Ansible has a wide variety of uses but for this project will be used for the automation of the deployments only
